1. Try to build Unreal Engine and Carla from source in my Ubuntu 20.04 cuda base docker container: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/

2. Also try to build Carla with Unreal Engine straight from a Github repo: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/    But this is in Ubuntu 18.04
